This repository contains projects I have made and am working on using Python.

My favorite projects in here are currently:
1) book_buddy: A mini app to analze .txt files and determine how long it will take a user to read them
2) Kiosk: A program that simulates a kiosk/convienence store and calculates a customers subtotal, tax, and total based upon items they purchased.

Descriptive table of contents:
1) archive: This folder contains past projects that are not currently assigned to other folders.
2) Kiosk: this folder contains the files for a kiosk app. Main.py is used to run the code and allow users to input their purchases and calculates their subtotal, tax, and total after tax.
3) book_buddy: This program is a mini app that analyzes a .txt file and accepts user input to determine how long it will take to read the .txt file based on their inputs.
