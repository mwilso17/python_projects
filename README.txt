This repository contains projects I have made and am working on using Python.

My favorite projects in here are currently:
1) goblin_generator.py

Descriptive table of contents:
1) goblin_generator.py - Creates a simple 'goblin' creature with low HP.
      Can be used for table top RPG games to make low level creatures that have
      their own personal hit points.
2) kelvin_to_fahrenheit.py - converts an integer in Kelvin to Fahrenheit. Can
      also be used as a Kelvin to Celsius calculator.
